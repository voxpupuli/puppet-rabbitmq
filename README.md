## Overview

This module manages RabbitMQ (www.rabbitmq.com)

## Module Description
The rabbitmq module sets up rabbitmq and has a number of providers to manage
everything from vhosts to exchanges after setup.

This module has been tested against 3.5.x and 3.6.x (as well as earlier
versions) and is known to not support all features against versions
prior to 2.7.1.

## Setup

### What rabbitmq affects

* rabbitmq repository files.
* rabbitmq package.
* rabbitmq configuration file.
* rabbitmq service.

## Usage

All options and configuration can be done through interacting with the parameters
on the main rabbitmq class.
These are now documented via [Puppet Strings](https://github.com/puppetlabs/puppet-strings)

You can view example usage in [REFERENCE](REFERENCE.md).

**[puppet/epel](https://forge.puppet.com/modules/puppet/epel) is a soft dependency. If you're on CentOS 7 and don't want to require it, set `$require_epel` to `false`**

Version v13.2.0 and older also added an erlang repository on CentOS 7. That isn't used and can be safely removed.

## Reference

See [REFERENCE](REFERENCE.md).
